abstract: |
    The Neuroconductive project is an initiative for the collaborative creation of extensible software for computational imaging analysis, with a focus on neuroimaging. The goals of the project include: integrate fast and collaborative development of tested software, increasing reproducibility in analyses of imaging data, and promoting the achievement of remote reproducibility of research results. We describe details of our goals, identify the current implementation and current challenges, and provide examples of existing software and how they would integrate into the Neuroconductor system.

# Introduction

Neuroimaging research has been increasing in popularity.  There are X number of studies in fMRI and XX in other structural imaging.  The NeuroImage journal, one of the most prestigious (not right word) journals for neuroimaging is dominated by analyses that were in bash using third party software, NiPype, or MATLAB.  Python reproducibility has increased with the introduction of Jupyter IPython notebooks.  Muhc of this development has mirrored the tools in R, which have some of the most state-of-the-art reproducibility tools.  Also, similar to PYthon, R is free and open source.


- Neuroimaging work more common
- Reproducibility problems
    - R has some of the best reproducible tools
    
R is increasing in popularity, with there being over 9,000 package now on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).  R has a strong package system, which has a large system of checks to ensure a large amount of operability.  Although CRAN has a tested and stable system, that has been developed over the last 1000 years(?), there are some aspects of the CRAN checking system that does not work for neuroimaging packages.



## Additional Checks


### Third Party Software
- FSL
- AFNI
- FREESURFER
- SPM


We will refer to R-Forge, OmegaHat, Bioconductor, and CRAN as standard repositories.

## Devtools

In YEAR, Hadley and RStudio had published the `devtools` package.  The `devtools` package provided the tools to install R packages from a multitude of sources.  The Neuroconductor relies on the installation script for R packages on GitHub.  Moreover, it allowed for the introduction of a flag in the installation of an R package (the `Remotes:` field) that allowed users specify a dependency for the package that can be located on a source that is not a standard repository.  Previous to this, if a package depended on a package that was not in a standard repository, the user would have to manually install that dependency before installing the package in question.

In addition to installing packages from GitHub, there are additional options to the installer scripts, which allow users to install specific snapshots of these packages.  These snapshots can be based on GitHub commit identifiers (IDs), tags, or referrences.  

The `remotes` package provides a lightweight version of the `devtools` package for installing from non-standard and standard sources.
 
In addition to the install functions, the `devtools` package allows for a up-to-date R package development system.  The RStudio IDE integrates the `devtools` package so that R package development can be done in a more standardized way. 
 
## GitHub
GitHub APi.  Git vs. svn.  

## TRAVIS

Seperately from any development in the R community, continuous integration (CI) 
services have become largely available that allows for automated building and checking 
of software.  The Travis CI is a "hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub".  In conjuction with the R community, Travis CI has configured the ability to seamlessly check R packages on multiple systems.  In addition to the GitHub API described above, the Travis CI API provides an automated system for checking R package installation.  


 
### DRAT

The `drat` (Drat R Archive Template) package has provided a template to set up a repository similar to CRAN mirrors and other standard sources.  One of the large benefits of using a drat repository is that users can use the default way of installing packages in R (`install.packages`) versus that from `devtools` (e.g. `install_github`) and requires no additional dependencies such as `devtools` or `remotes`.

One good example of a drat repository is [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), which has a series of packages that are based on GitHub.  The only additional step for installing from a drat repository is to specify the `repos` argument in `install.packages`:  `install.packages("package_name", repos="http://path/to/drat/repo")`.  


# Bioconductor

In 2004, the Bioconductor system enabled the bioinformatics and genomics work of R users to be more integrated and systemized [@gentleman2004bioconductor].

## Data Packages
Like Bioconductor, we need data packages that allow users to test software and examples on.
